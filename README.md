# Smart Attendance System with Dynamic QR Codes

A Django-based web application to automate and secure attendance tracking in educational institutions using dynamic QR codes.

---

## üìö **Brief Explanation of the Code**

This project is structured as a Django web application with the following modules:

- **Models:**  
  - Represents entities such as `Student`, `Teacher`, `Department`, `Course`, `User`, `ClassSession`, and `Attendance`
  - Each model corresponds to a normalized table in the MySQL database (all in 3NF).

- **Views:**  
  - Handle logic for dashboards, session creation, attendance marking, and reporting.
  - Role-based access: Students, Teachers, and Admins see different dashboards and actions.

- **Templates:**  
  - HTML files (using Bootstrap) render dashboards, forms, and reports for each user type.
  - Example: The **Student Dashboard** (see image) shows attendance percentage, a form to mark attendance, and a table of recent records.

- **Attendance Marking:**  
  - Students enter both Session ID and QR Code to mark attendance.
  - The backend checks:
    - If the session exists and is ongoing
    - If the QR code matches the session‚Äôs code
    - If the current time is within the QR validity window
    - If the student hasn‚Äôt already marked attendance

- **Reporting:**  
  - Teachers and admins can view attendance reports, with counts for Present, Absent, and Late.
  - CSV export is available.

- **Security:**  
  - Prevents proxy attendance by requiring both session ID and QR code.
  - Uses Django‚Äôs authentication and permissions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Installation of Necessary Libraries**

Before running the project, ensure you have Python 3.9+ and MySQL installed.

Install the required Python libraries using the following commands:
  ```
    pip install django==5.2
    pip install mysqlclient
    pip install qrcode
    pip install pillow
  ```

## üöÄ **Steps to Run the Project Locally**

1. **Set up the MySQL database:**
    - Create a database named `attendance_system` in MySQL.
    - Update `attendance_project/settings.py` with your MySQL credentials.

2. **Apply Django migrations:**
    ```
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

3. **Create a superuser:**
    ```
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

4. **Run the development server:**
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    - Visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser.

5. **Log in as admin/teacher/student and use the dashboards.**
    - Teachers can create sessions and generate QR codes.
    - Students can mark attendance using Session ID and QR code.

## üõ† **Troubleshooting**

- **TemplateSyntaxError:**  
  Do not use `.filter()` or `.count()` in Django templates.  
  Instead, compute counts in the view and pass them to the template as context variables.

- **MySQL client not installed:**  
  Install with `pip install mysqlclient`.

- **Import errors in management commands:**  
  Use `from attendance_app.models import ...` (not `attendance-app`), and ensure `__init__.py` files exist in all folders.

- **Attendance not showing:**  
  Ensure you are marking attendance with both Session ID and QR code, and that the session is ongoing and QR code is valid.
